# Heroes-of-Pymoli

After analyzing data for a fictional game, Heroes of Pymoli, I have learned quite a bit about users and the purchases they made in the game. With a total of 780 purchases made by 576 different players, it shows that some players made more than one purchase. 

One slight observation I noticed in the game is that the item "final critic" shows up with two different item IDs and two different prices. It could be an error or it could be used differently throughout the game, for example, buying the item before knowing the usefulness of it during a quest and buying it during the quest when the player realizes that it's absolutely necessary. 

After analyzing the demographics of the game, it seems that the majority of the players are male at a whopping 84%! A possible explanation for this could be the platform in which this game is on since males tend to play games on computers while females play on phones. However, looking at the purchase analysis by gender, the average purchase price for females is slightly higher than males. 

Looking at the age demographics of the game purchases, approximately 46% of the total amount of purchases were made by players in the age group 20-24 years old. This can be explained by the fact that people in this age category probably have a job and have more disposable income so they're able to purchase items in games in order to help them achieve their goals.

With the 5 most popular items, 4 of them are over $4 even though the average purchase price is only slightly over $3. With this information, the company can increase the usefulness of more items and price it a bit higher since people are willing to pay for it and increase their profits.
